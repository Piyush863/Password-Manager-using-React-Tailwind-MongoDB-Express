# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Here's a basic structure for a `README.md` file that describes your password manager project. Feel free to modify any details as needed:

# PassWord ManaGer - Your Own Password Manager

PassOP is a simple password manager that allows users to securely store and manage their website credentials (URL, username, and password). The interface is user-friendly, allowing for quick and easy saving, editing, and deleting of credentials. Additionally, users can copy their stored details with a single click.

## Features
- **Add new credentials**: Save your website's URL, username, and password.
- **Copy to clipboard**: Easily copy your credentials (site URL, username, or password) with a single click.
- **Edit entries**: Modify the details of existing credentials.
- **Delete entries**: Remove credentials that are no longer needed.
- **Password concealment**: Display passwords as asterisks (`*`) for added security.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application with utility-first CSS classes.
- **LordIcon**: For interactive animated icons.
- **JavaScript**: For frontend logic.
- **HTML & CSS**: For basic structure and styles.
